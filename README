A POSIX shell wrapper for "wc" supporting compressed files (.xz .lzma .bz2 .gz)

All options of "wc" can be used, and as for usual "wc",
it is possible to pass several files as arguments.

For standard input, the name of the command ("xzwc" "lzwc" "bzwc" or "zwc")
determines which type of compressed data is assumed.

For installation, copy the content of bin/ with executable permission
in your path. To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy the content
of zsh/ to a directory of zsh's $fpath.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
